# mm-timeline

This will be a new timeline app. 

The goal is that you can enter different milestones and events and they will be displayed in a nice way.
Additionally, it will be possible to create different types of events down the road. I imagine here being able to enter photos, links or text. 
By default, the complete timeline is always displayed, with a click on a milestone you get a view of all points of this. So also with events. 
Let's see how many hierarchy levels are useful here.

This is only the rough concept for now - the further development is still in planning ;-)
